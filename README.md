# Breast-cancer-risk-prediction

Objective:
The repository is a learning exercise to:

1. Apply the fundamental concepts of machine learning from an available dataset
2. Evaluate and interpret my results and justify my interpretation based on observed data set
3. Create notebooks that serve as computational records and document my thought process.

The analysis is divided into four sections, saved in juypter notebooks in this repository

1. Identifying the problem and Data Sources
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Pre-Processing the Data
4. Build model to predict whether breast cell tissue is malignant or Benign
